# Welcome to the Bioinformatics of Single Cell Genomes Workshop!

This morning, we will get your computational environments set up through [jupyterhub.bigelow.org]. And orient you to course resources.  

## Lesson Resources  
The majority of course lessons are available through our course GitHub organization, the [Bigelow-eSCG-tutorials](https://github.com/Bigelow-eSCG-tutorials/) on github. There, you'll find a number of different repositories for lessons we'll be covering this week. As we begin a lesson, we'll pull down the appropriate course material from this webpage. 

## Computational Environment  
For ease of use, we have put together an online virtual HPC environment that we will all be using this week. It is a 'jupyterhub', which we'll affectionately refer to as the 'Hub.

To get set up in the course jupyterhub, checkout this tutorial, which we will go through together on Day 1 [the hub intro](https://github.com/Bigelow-SCG-Course/Day1AM_intro_to_jupyterhub/blob/main/Intro_to_the_hub.md).
